// BACK-END
// What is back-end? - another computer that manages the data of the website
// The computer which sends data to the backend is called the front-end
// When two computers are connected to each other via the internet, then they can send messages to each other with the help of the HTTP protocol

// NOTE: When reading this, also refer to the backend-practice.js file within the data folder for implementation and other important
// implementation related notes

// When we send a message to the BACK-END, it is called a REQUEST
// The message the backend sends back to us is called a RESPONSE
// For every single REQUEST we send, we get exacctly 1 repsonse back from the back-end
// This is called the REQUEST-RESPONSE CYCLE: it entails 1 request and 1 response
