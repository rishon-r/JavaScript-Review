- The MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern is a widely used architectural pattern in software development, especially for designing user interfaces.
- It helps separate concerns, making code organized, modular, and easier to maintain or scale.
- MVC divides an application into three core components
  A. Model -Saves and manages data, manages business logic, and the rules of the application
  B. View - Handles the presentation layer – what the user sees and interacts with
  C. Controller - Acts as an intermediary between Model and View – it handles user input, updates the model, and refreshes the view

- MVC Workflow:

  1. User interacts with the View (e.g., clicks a button).

  2. The Controller receives input and decides what to do.

  3. The Controller updates the Model (e.g., changes data or business logic).

  4. The Model notifies the View that data has changed.

  5. The View updates itself to reflect the new state of the Model.
