// Before discussing the console.log() function, let us first describe a JS feature that we have been using for a while now
// This feature is the comments
// Single-line comments in JS are created with two forward slashes
/* Multi
Line comments
are created with a forward slash and asterisk as seen here
and closed with an asterisk followed by a forward slash as seen

// Now , what does console.log() do?
// console.log() is a built-in function in JavaScript used to print output to the browser’s console
// It is used mainly for debugging and diagnostics.
// It doesn't affect the web page itself — it prints messages to the developer console
// Example below:
console.log('Hello World');

// You can log one or more values.
// It can log strings, numbers, objects, arrays, functions, or results of expressions.
// Syntax: console.log(value1, value2, ..., valueN);
