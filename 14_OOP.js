// OOP- Object Oriented Programming
// A different method of programming that involves organizing your code into objects
// So far, we have used PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING
// A procedure refers to a set of step-by-step instructions
// in PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING we organize our code into functions

// In OOP, we group our data and functions into objects
// Why do we use OOP?
// OOP tries to represent the real world
// E.g in real life, a cart can have properties inside it and we can perform actions to modify a cart
// Some developers feel that this makes the code more intuitive

// Another important reason to use objects is that it is easy to create multiple objects
